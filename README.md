# Vault
Vault project for 'Road to Web3'

A vault is a safe, where the user can store tokens.
A vault is lockable and unlockable, and has only one owner, who posseses the KEY which is an NFT. The vault can be transferred to another person, and the KEY will also be transferred to them. 

The user is not allowed to manually create a vault, but must only use the vaults through the vaultManager.
